# Work Tracker Project

This simple web application allows users to track work details and save them to a Google Sheet. The project includes an HTML form with fields for date, time, description, bug ID, and actions taken. Users can fill out the form and click the "Save" button to store the data in a specified Google Sheets document using the Google Sheets API. The styling is minimal and designed for a clean user interface.
